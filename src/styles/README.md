# src/styles

Contains styles for the React project, primarily in SCSS format.
The main SCSS file is `main.scss`, which only imports other SCSS files.
All other SCSS files should start with an underscore `_` if they are not imported directly by a React component.
Files starting with an underscore are considered private and should not be accessed directly by React components.
