# src/components

Contains reusable components.
These components are loosely coupled and controlled through props.
They should manage their own state only.
Components that use API calls or global state management are considered shared components rather than reusable ones.
Examples of reusable components include `IMSButton`, `IMSBreadcrumb`, `Loader`, `IMSTable`, etc.
